# masterpiece-game-resources
Lightweight repo for images ("paintings") as well as other configurable resources.

## Reasoning for Separate Repo
The idea behind this as a separate repo is that it can be a means for the actual game to pull content as needed without having to update, re-containerize, and redeploy the game server code.
